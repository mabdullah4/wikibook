## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tradeoffs:

1. Since this is a small application with only two pages the folder structure of the app is also simple and does not really mirror on how I would structure the bigger application
2. Also for the apis, a more proper system would be used depending on the project.
3. The images of the books, the mockup data has 35 books and it was diffcult to find covers for all and was taking too much time so I just used one for all. :-)
